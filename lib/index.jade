			## About
	
			Build tools that require a lot of explicit/declarative instructions are distracting.
			Anvil is a build system with an extension-based architecture that prefers convention over configuration. There are a lot of great ways to add new features or change almost any behavior as needed.  
			
			### This Site
			This site is a group effort to document the features and some of the extensions to Anvil. The source to the site itself is hosted [here](http://github.com/anviljs/anviljs.github.com).
			If you so desire, you can submit pull requests to add documentation for your extensions or for things about the system you'd like to see covered.

			h2 Basic Features
	
			p All parts of the build process are implemented as extensions (specifically as build plugins). Some extensions ship along with anvil's source so that it can do _something_ out of the box. Most of the interesting features will likely be extensions that you install.
	
			p A baseline install can do the following:
			ul
				li Install, remove, enable or disable extensions
				li Automatically install any extensions your build file defines as dependencies
				li Run local extensions (an extension that's not installed from npm)
				li Continuously and incrementally build the project as files change
				li Host static resources in an HTTP server
					ul
						li Auto-refresh pages in the browser during CI mode
						li Provides APIs to extensions for customized behavior
				li Start and manage external processes
				li Combine resource files through a comment-based import syntax
				li Concat resource files in specified order using
					ul
						li JSON or YAML file that lists files to create from other files
						li individual JSON or YAML files
				li Replace tokens (with customizable syntax) in source with 
					ul
						li values from package.json
						li JSON or YAML key/value files
				li Add file headers to final build output based on output file type
				li Create default build files based on installed extensions
